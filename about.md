I am a 15-ish year old lady Jack Russell terrier X, rehomed from Shoreham Dogs Trust in March 2009 and now living a happy and active life in Brighton.

For Christmas 2009 my humans were given a "Pet's eve view camera", which they let me use to take photos on some of my walks. But mostly now I have other people take photos of me.

My hobbies include chasing woodland animals, eating, sleeping and sniffing.
