4 things you need to know
Gmail is a little bit different. Learn these 4 basics and you'll never look
back.

1. Archive instead of delete
Tidy up your inbox without deleting anything. You can always search to find
what you need or look in "All Mail."

2. Chat and video chat
Chat directly within Gmail. You can even talk face-to-face with built-in
video chat.

3. Labels instead of folders
Labels do the work of folders with an extra bonus: you can add more than
one to an email.

4. Conversation view
Gmail groups emails and their replies in your inbox, so you always see your
messages in the context of your conversation. Related messages are stacked
neatly on top of each other, like a deck of cards.
